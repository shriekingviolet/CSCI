Cool repo for Comp Sci class, hi

There's a pretty cool guide on how github works here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Basically:
There's a main branch
You can create other branches which start out as copies of the main branch
You can upload edits to those other branches
Then you can make a pull request, which might me like
  "Updated formating
      Yo, I made the formatting look nicer. Please commit this change."
And then the other person can be like, yeah for sure, and update the change to main and delete the old branch
